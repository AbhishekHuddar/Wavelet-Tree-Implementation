# Wavelet-Tree-Implementation
The purpose of this project is to understand the algorithmic implementation of wavelet tree using suffix array for pattern matching
Here we are using wavelet tree in order to understand how pattern matching can be done with any given "string" pattern
The output of the program shows how the time and space complexities associated with running of the program.
The program runs in O(n) linear time
How to run:
The files can be run on ecliplse, netbeans, intellij or any java IDE
